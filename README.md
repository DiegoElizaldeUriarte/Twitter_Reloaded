Twitter Reloaded is a social media platform that allows users to create tweets with 300 characters maximum, reply to tweets, and see their home dashboard with the recent 10 tweets. The dashboard contains tweets and threads. Every action triggered by Twitter Reloaded is registered as a new event at the event dashboard, with information such as the type of action, user who did the action, and timestamp. Reports can be generated based on the event data, such as the user who registered more events during the day, the most commented tweet of the day, and how many users opened the application during the day.
